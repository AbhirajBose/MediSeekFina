# MediSeekFinal
<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
<h5>1)Pharmaceutical Websites have become very complex these days.People are trying to find the best medicinal products at quite affordable prices.</h5>
<h5>2)To do this,people have to vist each and every pharmaceutical website to check the different prices all over the Internet.This makes it a cumbersome task for a customer</h5>
<h5>3)To solve this problem,we came up with a solution of developing a website named "Mediseek"</h5>

<h4>Usecase</h4>
<h5>It will contain a comparison chart of different pharmaceutical websites comparing the medicines that our customers want.It will basically consist of renowned pharmaceutical websites like Pharmeasy,Netmeds,1mg and Apollo Pharmacy</h5>

<h4>What problem does our project solve</h4>
<h5>1)Mediseek is a trusted platform to compare pharmaceutical products and buy them with satisfaction. We compare the medicines on grounds of customer reviews,ratings,expiry date,manufacturer,brands etc.</h5>
<h5>2)Here we allow users to compare and buy the medicines according to their choices. We provide the freedom to choose the medicines from renowned pharmaceutical websites by comparing the customer reviews,ratings ,prices,branding etc.Explore to find more...</h5>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<h5>1)In the landing page,the user will be able to see the intro pages of our website and also what does our website works for.It will also contain the motto of our website</h5>
<h5>2)It also contains the navbar at the top which will contain the Homepage,shop section,about us section,and profile section</h5>
<h5>3)It contains the newsletter section at the last section </h5>
<h5>4)Under the shop section,we are having our autocomplete search bar which displays the different medicines which we use in our daily life</h5>
<h5>5)In the about us section,we have our team panel details which you can get through</h5>
<h5>6)Lastly,at a profile section,we need to register and sign up for accessing our website advantages.</h5>

<h4>Challenges we ran into</h4>
<h5>1)We are facing difficulty in adding the shop section as we are new to backend development as of now</h5>
<h5>2)We are trying to host the whole code on a platform,but we faced quite a good number of issues to do it</h5>

<h4>Whats next for our project</h4>
